Actix Web Server
Actix Logo

Actix is a high-performance web framework for Rust language. It is built on top of the Actix actor framework, which allows it to provide excellent performance with low resource consumption.

This repository contains a basic example of how to build a web server using Actix. The server serves a simple "Hello, World!" message at the root URL.

Getting Started
To run this example, you will need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can download Rust from the official website.

Once Rust is installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/actix/examples.git
cd examples/hello
Then, you can start the server by running:

sh
Copy code
cargo run
You should see the following output:

sh
Copy code
Started http server: 127.0.0.1:8080
Now, if you open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080, you should see the "Hello, World!" message.

Project Structure
The project consists of two files:

src/main.rs: This file contains the code for setting up the web server and defining the request handlers.
Cargo.toml: This file contains the dependencies and configuration information for the project.
